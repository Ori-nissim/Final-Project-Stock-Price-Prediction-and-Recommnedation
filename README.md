## Stock-Price-Prediction-and-Recommnedation
Developed a ML model that outputs recommendations to buy/sell/hold the stock from 3
individual models - each one is trained on different data source, built on Google Collab.
Results are combined afterwards by majority vote. I Built the action recommendation
from the direction predicted by the models and got almost 4 times the profit!
* Using Pandas to perform complex data manipulation.
* Creating new data from existing data and combining different data from multiple
sources.
* Developed a generic function to train/test a model in a custom time periods.
* Inserted past data into every row in the table so the model can compare current
price and calculate momentum.
* Testing different models and different data on different models
* Using profit, precision, specificity as model evaluation metrics
* Main Libraries used: Sklearn, Matplotlib, Pandas, NLTK.
* Data from APIs: yfinance, stockstats, fundamentalanalysis, New York Times

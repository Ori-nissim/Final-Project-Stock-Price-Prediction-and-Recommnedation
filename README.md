## Stock-Price-Prediction-and-Recommnedation
* A Machine learning model I built from scratch that outputs recommendations to buy/sell/hold the stock.
* To gather the stock data, in this case S&P500 I used yfinance API to get the stock data
* From the stock data - Daily high,low,close,open prices I calculated technical indicators and added information about past days.
* Many libraries and tool are used through out this project such as Pandas,Numpy,plt,pandas Technical Analisys, Stock stats, seaborn and of course Sklearn.
### Following the model recommendations got us a **24.38%** return on our investment, tested on a 2 year period
* The Model recommended a total of **12** Buy/Sell Actions 
* The Model outpreformed the no-actions return (11.61%) from 2020-12-18 to 2022-12-13 , more than double that return!

**24.38 / 11.61 = ~ 2.1**
